        <h4>What are CCTV cameras?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">
            CCTV stands for Closed Circuit Television and it is one of the most commonly used security solutions today. This system consists of a number of cameras mounted in a closed circuit system and the feed from these cameras can only be accessed by a dedicated security station. These cameras are placed in strategic locations across the property to monitor activity. The number of cameras on a property depends on its size, number of access points, traffic, and various other factors. Here are some of the different components of a CCTV system:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>CCTV cameras.</li>
